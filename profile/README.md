[Topology](https://topology.vc/) is a frontier tech venture firm with an engineering-first approach.

Our name is inspired by topological dimension reduction — a mathematical and machine learning technique that simplifies complex, high‑dimensional data while preserving essential features and core qualities. We see our work as similar: distilling intricate webs of information into key insights that drive high‑conviction investments and long term partnerships.

We invest in early-stage startups in AI, neurotech, and crypto. If you're building - reach out.
